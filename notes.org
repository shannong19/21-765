** Objectives
  + sequential algorithm to parallel algorithm
  + learn more about computers
  + get better at documenting and writing packages

To take this class or not.  It seems pretty useful, but Friday evenings...  

Module 8 onward are parallel things which seems pretty useful.

* Overview of Class

* Projects and Homework
  [[http://www.math.cmu.edu/~florin/M21-765/homeworks.html][Project Criterion]]
  + Start thinking of a project (ABM)
    + Can be related to my work, documentation is important
    + Design matters - modularity
    + Debugging is important!
    + Code will take the least amount of time
    + Set reasonable goals
  + homework - do it but not graded, can get answers
